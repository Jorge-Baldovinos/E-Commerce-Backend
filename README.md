# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description
This project was created as the backend of an e commerce website to test RESTful API routes. The code uses Sequelize as an ORM( Object Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the relational database as a JavaScript Object. The website is made through refactored code from a coding boot camp challenge. 

## Usage
![Website Screenshot](assets/Website-Screenshot.png) 
To use the application, the user must first open the terminal, navigate through directories and locate E-Commerce-Backend. Once there, the user must navigate to the db directory and run the schema.sql file to create the database and connect to it. Next, the user must run "npm run seed" in the terminal to run the index.js file that will seed the database. Next, the user must run "npm run start" to run the server.js file that will run the application along with the API routes and queries. In order to test the API routes, the user must use a tester such as Insomnia or ThounderClient. [User Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhuJ-VMa9HMFQb3InngUJanWV-kz_AgF/view?usp=sharing)
